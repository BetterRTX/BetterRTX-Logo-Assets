You May Customize these Logos for use in showcases involving BetterRTX. 

Videos are not required to have a BetterRTX Logo, but it is recommended when creating a showcase video. 

These logos were edited and designed by multiple members of the BetterRTX team.
Thanks to Zappr and Yaseung, we have multiple file types, versions, and other animations!

# Editing Tips from Zappr:

If you would like to make these transparent in-software, you can luma-key the black out,
or use a green screen key tool to key out the black.

For Adobe products, go into the effects panel and search for "luma" 
drag the Luma key template on to the logo video. That should
make the black parts of the clip transparent.

For Davinci Resolve, use the 3D keyer in the OpenFX panel or color tab,
and draw a bit on the black parts of the logo. Adjust the black clip
until the black outline/halo is gone from the logo.

Keep in mind these are for advanced editors and there are perfectly
usable transparent clips provided! -Zappr
